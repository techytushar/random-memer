# Random Memer

Flask API to return random programming meme images scrapped from [Memedroid](https://www.memedroid.com/memes/tag/programming).

### Usage Notes:

Just add `img` tag in your website / README file and it will display a random meme everytime the website is loaded

```html
<img src='URL' title="Meme" alt="Please refresh the page if the meme doesn't show up.">
```
